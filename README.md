# I2C_Communication
Knight Rider and DC Motor Control Application with I2C

The aim of this project is to learn the basis of I2C communication. Initially, Raspberry Pi Pico sends the data to Arduino Uno, and leds work one by one as a knight rider application. At the same time, Arduino Uno sends the data (the message) to the Raspberry Pi Pico, and then the dc motor works with this message that comes from Arduino Uno.
